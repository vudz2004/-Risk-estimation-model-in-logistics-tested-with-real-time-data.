🎯 TOPIC: Risk management in Logistics

📄 Describe

Use data recovery mechanism to reconstruct loss variable for gamma glm correction, Estimate delay probability with Binominal GLM. Determine cost of each order by product of 1st and 2nd layer estimates (GLM). Thereby calculate and build Relativities table. 

Test Apache Kafka for dynamic pricing.

💡 Target:

Building and designing data simulations using recovery statistics.
Researching and testing a quantitative model of delay risk in the Logistics field using the GLM model.
Building an insurance pricing system for real-time data.

📌 This research is part of a graduate thesis in MFE-Neu.
